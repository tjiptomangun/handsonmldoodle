1. Machine Learning is the science and art of programming computers 
   so they can learn from data.
   Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers 
   ability to learn without explicitly programmed.
   A computer program is said to learn from experience E 
   with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,
   if its performance on T, as measure by P, improves with 
   experience E.

2. Type of problem where Machine Learning shines
  1. Problem which solutions require a lot of hand-tuning 
     or long lists of rules. 
  2. Complex solution which there is no good solution at all
     using traditional approach or no known algorithm.
  3. Fluctuating Environment.
  4. Getting insights about complex problems and large amount
     of data.

3. Labelled training set is training data with desired solutions

4. Two most common supervised tasks
 a. Classification
 b. Predict target numeric value

5. Four most common supervised tasks
 a. Clustering, grouping large amount of unlabelled data
 b. Dimensionality reduction, simplify data without loosing
    too much information.
 c. Anomaly Detection, the system trained with normal instances,
    and when it sees new instance it can tell it looks
    like normal or anomaly
 d. Association rule learning, dig large amount of data 
    and discover interesting relations between attributes.

6. Machine Learning Algorithm for robot to walk in terrains is
   Reinforcement Learning

7. Algorithm to segment customers into multiple groups is clustering

8. Spam detection is supervised learning problem

9. Online Learning System is system that learn incrementally, that is
   new set of training data does not require system to trained using
   all previous data plus new data.

10. Out of Core Learning is train systems of huge datasets that cannot
    fit in one's main memory

11. Type of learning that relies of similarity measure is instance
    based generalization (instance based learning)

12. Model Parameter vs Hyperparameter
    Model Parameter is parameter set by learning algoritm
    Hyperparamer is paramter set to adjust learning algorithm
